Task 1: Implementing Linear Regression Model
Data Exploration:

Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and characteristics.
Identify the relevant columns for your linear regression model (square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the target variable - house prices).
Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing or null values in the dataset.
Check for outliers and decide on an approach to handle them (remove outliers, transform data, etc.).
Convert categorical variables into numerical format if needed.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to understand the distribution of the features and the target variable.
Check for correlations between features and the target variable.
Splitting the Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This is essential for evaluating the performance of your model.
Linear Regression Model:

Implement a linear regression model using a machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn in Python).
Train the model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of your model on the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for regression models include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Interpret Results:

Interpret the results of your model. Understand the coefficients assigned to each feature and how they contribute to predicting house prices.
GitHub Repository:

Upload your code to the GitHub repository following the naming convention provided in the general instructions.
LinkedIn Post:

Create a post on LinkedIn summarizing Task 1. Highlight what you learned, the challenges you faced, and any insights gained from implementing the linear regression model. Optionally, include a video explaining your work.
